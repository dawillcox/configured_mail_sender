Send emails for a Python application without the application
having to deal with the details of connecting to the requested
outgoing email domain.

``configured_email_sender`` determines
how to connect to and authenticate with the appropriate
server using system and user-specific configuration files.
See the `README <https://github.com/dawillcox/configured_mail_sender/blob/main/README.rst>`_
for details.
