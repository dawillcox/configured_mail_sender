# Global, service-specific settings for each supported domain.
# protocol identifies the mail protocol implementation.

yahoo.com:
    protocol: smtp      # Can be smtp or gmail. smtp is assumed
    server: smtp.mail.yahoo.com
    port: 587
    security: STARTTLS  # Allowed values are SSL (normally port 465) or STARTTLS (normally port 587)
                        # Security of NONE is defined, but untested and isn't guaranteed to work.
    # It isn't necessary to specify both port and security. If one of the standard ports, 25, 465, or 587
    # is given, the normal security for that port is used. If just one of the value security
    # values is given, the standard port for that security is used. If the server uses some
    # nonstandard port, both port and security must be given.
    # If neither are given, port 465 and security SSL are used.
